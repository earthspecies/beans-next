# Code style
- Use NumPy style for docstrings. If any exceptions are raised make sure that they're documented in the "Raises" section.
- When you make changes to the logic of a function or class make sure its docstring is still valid. If required, update the docstrong to match the changes.
- Run `ruff check --fix` to make sure your code is formatter correctly.
- Use single backticks for inline code references in docstrings
- Don't use conditional `if TYPE_CHECKING`
- Always add a `__all__` in `__init__.py` with strings of units that are exported
- Make sure that only objects that are needed outside a module are exposed in the `__init__.py`. Tests don't count as external usage; they should import directly from the submodule if something isn't in `__init__.py`.

# Key Directories
- `beans_next` - main python library

# Environment Setup
- **All Python commands must run via `uv` inside the repo-local virtualenv.**
- Use `uv sync` to create/update `.venv/` for this repo.
- Use `uv run ...` for everything (e.g. `uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff check --fix`, `uv run python -m ...`).
- Do **not** run tools with system Python (avoid bare `python`, `pytest`, `ruff`) and do **not** use `pip` directly.
